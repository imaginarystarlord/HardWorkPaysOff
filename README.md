Linear Regression Implementation
- It is basically implementation of Concept of Linear Regression,
- I made 2-3 helper function like Gradient, error function
- I take 100 iteration to converge so i get proper values of theta at which error is minimum and
- Used suitable learning rate to get 97% accuracy on Testing Data
